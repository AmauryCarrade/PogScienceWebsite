# PogScience website

This repository hosts the PogScience website. This project is tailored for the PogScience community, but can be adapted
for every other Twitch streaming group by updating the templates a little.

## Features

Planned features for the first stable version are:

- list of all streamers in the group;
- monitoring of lives from these streamers, real-time, using the Twitch API and Twitch webhooks;
- sync of planned streams, from both Twitch Schedules and Google Calendar (if any);
- display of the live and upcoming streams on the homepage, plus a dedicated page with the full calendar;
- no maintenance when configured, reusing existing sources, so streamers don't have another system to update;
- Twitch login for administrators and streamers, to avoid an extra account;
- press page with statistics and such.

Planned features after the first version are:

- option to raid other streamers with a single click, if logged in;
- group events support: streamers and administrators will be able to create a dedicated webpage for group-wide events,
  in the spirit of [`generations-sorciers.fr`](https://generations-sorciers.fr) (French only), with a description and a
  calendar of streams in the event.

## Installation

We develop this website with Python 3.9+, pipenv, Django, NodeJS 12+, and webpack.

### Development version

A Makefile helps developers to install and run the development environnement locally, on UNIX-like systems. Run `make`
for help.

You need to have globally available Python 3.9 or later, NodeJS 12 or later, pipenv (`pip install pipenv`), and
optionally [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) for Twitch EventSub support in development mode. Then:

```shell
$ make install  # Install all dependencies.
$ make run      # Run the server in development mode, and webpack in watch mode,
                # with an HTTPS tunnel for Twitch EventSub support.
```

The port will be printed on the console. It is usually [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000). For the Twitch login
to work (see below), you have to use the `localhost` URL (not `127.0.0.1`). A link to the ngrok control panel, including
handy Twitch EventSub requests log and replay options, is also printed on the console (it is always
[`127.0.0.1:4040`](http://127.0.0.1:4040)). [See below for details.](#how-to-test-twitch-eventsub-in-development)

‚ö†Ô∏è **The `make run` command above will open an HTTPS tunnel from your localhost to the internet**, with a
randomized URL that will be displayed at the top of the command output. If you don't want to open such a tunnel, use
`make run-local` instead.

We use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the Python code. `make install` above will install a pre-commit
hook to reformat the whole projet at each commit. If it didn't, run `pre-commit install` from within the virtualenv. If
a commit fail because of `black`, commit again. The code formatting was fixed.

### Production deployment

TODO, but: Ansible. üî•

### Secrets

As it use Google and Twitch APIs, this website needs some secrets to work correctly. You'll have to [create a Twitch
application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), the callback URL being `http://localhost:8000/complete/twitch/` _exactly_.

If you want to be able to import events from Google Calendar, you also need a Google API Key. On the [Google Cloud
Console](https://console.cloud.google.com):

1. [create a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate);
2. in [_API and services_](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard), click ‚ÄúEnable API and services‚Äù at the top
   left of the page, then lookup for ‚Äúcalendar‚Äù, and enable the Google Calendar API; 
3. in [‚ÄúIdentifiers‚Äù under _API and services_](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), create a new API Key
   (you don't need an  OAuth Client ID for this as we only read public calendars). I recommend restricting the API Key
   to the Google Calendar API only.
   
Now that you have all secrets you need, duplicate the `secrets.example.toml` file, rename it as `secrets.toml`, and
write the secrets in it.

### How to test Twitch EventSub in development

As Twitch need to send requests to your local installation, you'll have to install some sort of port forwarding system
_with HTTPS support_. The simplest option is [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) with a free account. Create an account, configure
the ngrok client as specified by their documentation, then run `make run`. ngrok will be started and the tunnel URL,
automatically registered into Django.

The HTTPS tunnel should close when you stop the `make run` command with Ctrl+C. If not, use `make stop` to stop every
PogScience background services (only ngrok, currently).

The tunnel URL change everytime you start the tunnel (so, everytime you `make run`). As Twitch store the URL to send
requests, you need to renew every subscription with the new URL when you launch the website. To do so, run `make resub` in another
terminal.

_While the `subscribe` command is running, you may see a lot of 404's for `POST /twitch/eventsub/ingest` requests in the
[ngrok inspector](http://127.0.0.1:4040/inspect/http). That's completely normal: hooks are only saved in the database
when the command ends (because it run in a transaction), and the endpoint 404 if called for an unknown hook. Twitch will
retry a few seconds later (using an exponential backoff), and you'll start seeing `200 OK` responses when the command
is complete._

You may also want to run this one to be in sync with the current lives.

```bash
$ ./manage.py synclivestreams --full
```

## Commands

We added a few commands to the Django commands system. Add `--help` for help on each command.

- `./manage.py syncschedules` ‚Äî Loads scheduled streams from Twitch and Google Calendar. _Every 15 min in production._
- `./manage.py subscribe` ‚Äî Subscribes not-yet-subscribed streamers to EventSub-based Twitch live updates. _Every 15 min
  in production, to renew Twitch-revoked subscriptions._
- `./manage.py unsubscribe [streamer_twitch_id‚Ä¶]` ‚Äî Unsubscribes the given (or all, if none given) streamers from
  EventSub-based Twitch live updates.
- `./manage.py synclivestreams` ‚Äî Updates viewers count and stream preview for every online stream. Does nothing if no
  one is online. _Every 2 min in production._

_Scheduled tasks shall not be executed at the same time in production._
